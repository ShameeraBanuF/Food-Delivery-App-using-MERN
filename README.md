Approach to create Restaurant App using MERN:

1. Import Statements:
•Import necessary dependencies and components.
•React is imported for defining React components.
•RestaurantList, RestaurantCard, DishesMenu, DishCard and Cart are custom components, assumed to be present in the ./components directory.
•RestaurantContext is imported, presumably a custom context provider.

2.Functional Component:
•Define a functional component named App.

3.Context Provider:
•Wrap the App component inside the RestaurantContext provider. This suggests that the components within this provider have access to the context provided by RestaurantContext.

4.Component Rendering:
•Render the following components:
RestaurantContext: Presumably, this is a context provider that wraps its child components (App). The purpose of this context is not clear from the provided code snippet.
•All other components such as RestaurantList and DishesMenu is wrapped inside App component so it also has the access of RestaurantContext.
RestaurantList wraps RestaurantCard

Steps to create Application:
Step 1: creating the folder for the project

mkdir food-delivery-app
cd food-delivery-app
Step 2: Create a backend using the following commands

mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
Step 3: Install the required dependencies.

npm i cors express mongoose nodemon

Backend Dependencies:

"dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.0.3",
    "nodemon": "^3.0.2"
}
//Create server.js file and add the following code.

Step 4: To start the backend run the following command.

nodemon server.js
Step 5: Go to the root directory of the application and create the frontend application.

npx create-react-app client
cd client
Step 6: Install important dependencies: axios

npm i axios

Frontend dependencies:

 "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "axios": "^1.6.5",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.21.1",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
}
Create the required files and add the following code.
1. /* App.css */
2. //index.js (update previous index.js)
3. // App.js
4. //RestaurantContext.js
5. //Cart.js
6. //DishCard.js
7. //DishesMenu.jS
8. //PreviousOrders.js
9. //RestaurantCard.js
10. //RestaurantList.js

Step 7: To start the frontend run the following command.

npm start
